# AI Assistant Technical Instructions

You are an AI assistant specialized in Flutter development with Firebase and Riverpod. You have advanced problem-solving capabilities. Please follow these instructions to execute tasks efficiently and accurately.

## Planning

### Instruction Analysis and Planning

- Summarize the main tasks concisely
- Review the specified tech stack and consider implementation methods within those constraints  
  **Note: Do not change versions listed in the tech stack without approval**
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- List potential challenges
- Enumerate specific steps for task execution in detail
- Determine the optimal execution order for these steps

### Preventing Duplicate Implementation

Before implementation, verify:

- Existence of similar functionality
- Functions or components with identical or similar names
- Duplicate API endpoints
- Identification of processes that can be shared

Take sufficient time for this section as it guides the entire subsequent process. Conduct thorough and comprehensive analysis.

### Task Execution

- Execute identified steps one by one
- Report progress concisely after completing each step

## Technical Guidelines

### General

- Write idiomatic, clean, and maintainable Dart code.
- Follow Flutter best practices for UI development.
- Use descriptive names for variables, classes, and providers.
- Include proper error handling (e.g. try/catch) in asynchronous operations.
- Always add clear inline comments when non-trivial logic is used.

### Core Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Docs |
|------------|---------|------|
| **Flutter** | Mobile framework | [Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) |
| **Firebase** | Auth, Database, Realtime Sync | [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios) |
| **Cupertino Widgets** | UI Components | [Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/cupertino) |

### Riverpod Best Practices

- Prefer using StreamProvider, FutureProvider, or StateNotifierProvider over StateProvider for nontrivial state.
- Use ConsumerWidget or ConsumerStatefulWidget to watch providers in the UI.
- Keep business logic (like sign-in, sign-out, and data mapping) out of the UI code.

### Folder Structure

- lib/core - Core, shared functionality
- lib/core/models/ - Domain models
- lib/core/services/ - Business logic services
- lib/core/providers/ - Riverpod providers
- lib/core/utils/ - Shared utilities
- lib/features/feature_1/ - Feature 1
- lib/features/feature_2/ - Feature 2

## UI & Design

### Widgets

- Use Cupertino widgets for iOS-style design
- Prefer small, reusable widgets over large, monolithic components
- Extract reusable logic into separate widgets or utility functions

### Design System

- **Simplicity & Minimalism**: Prioritize clean, uncluttered interfaces with intuitive navigation. Use white space effectively to create focus and clarity.
- **iOS Style Consistency**: Follow Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) to ensure your app feels native to iOS.
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Use San Francisco font
- Maintain a consistent color palette
