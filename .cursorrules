# Baby Tracking App

## Project Management

Maintain a markdown file in instruction folder called `Tasks.md` that keeps track of things we need to do. We'll collaborate on this file and both add and remove items as we work on the project.

## Overview

I want to create a baby tracking app built in Flutter using Firebase for Authentication, Storage, and Realtime Sync. It will be an AI-first app, depending heavily on voice input. Users will use iOS AppIntents and the equivalent on Android to log things like feedings, nursing, medicine, sleep, etc.

### Core Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Docs |
|------------|---------|------|
| **Flutter** | Mobile framework | [Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) |
| **Firebase** | Auth, Database, Realtime Sync | [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios) |
| **Cupertino Widgets** | UI Components | [Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/cupertino) |

## Important Notes

- Please look for existing files and classes with the same or similar name before creating new ones.
- Please work step by step and evaluate your work before moving on to the next step.
- Please use the Cupertino widgets for the UI.
- Always use full path when importing instead of relative paths
- Do not modify the pubspec.yaml file. Instead ask me to add a dependency.
